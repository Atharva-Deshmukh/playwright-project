Techniquest to pause a Test:
---------------------------

Way-1: 
await page.pause(); // built-in Playwright debugger

Way-2:
await new Promise(() => {}); // freezes test

What it does:

new Promise(() => {}) — you construct a Promise, but the executor function (() => {}) 
doesn’t call resolve or reject.

That means the Promise stays pending forever.

Since you await it, the test (or script) will pause indefinitely at that line and never move forward.
